# ReCAP - Repository of Cognitive Attack Patterns

## Introduction
Whether designing massive enterprise IT infrastructure or embedded cyber-physical systems, the cybersecurity assessment is a critical activity that often occurs multiple times during product development. Assessments typically involve iterating over a list of known vulnerabilities or attacks and determining if they are applicable to the current system. Effective protection against cyber-attacks in mixed-reality (MR) systems requires an understanding of how an adversary may exploit a cognitive vulnerability. As part of the Modeling and Analysis Toolkit for Realizable Intrinsic Cognitive Security (MATRICS) effort on the DARPA Intrinsic Cognitive Security (ICS) program, Collins is building a public-facing Repository of Cognitive Attack Patterns (ReCAP) that enumerate cognitive attacks and corresponding mitigations to facilitate the elicitation of cognitive guarantees.
